#Console-based hearts for android, written in C  

A small game, made for and built on Android device. Mainly to test AI strategy, but also as a small hobby project that could be revised on the fly, from anywhere.

Poorly commented, and likely not the most streamlined implementation, but proof-of-concept of bus programming. Project in progress off and on, not sure how much total time spent on it.

WARNING: Not portable, uses header files which are unsupported on some platforms.
